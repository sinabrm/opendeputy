# Renderer Control Broker

## Purpose

This module carries agent browser and right-panel actions from the server to the
client that owns the relevant renderer state, and the result back. Both the
browser view and panel store live in a renderer, not the server process, so the
server can only ask their current owner and wait.

## Boundaries

- `broker.js` owns request lifetime: it publishes one action through the
  injected `emitRequest`, holds the pending request, and settles it on a client
  result, a timeout, or an abort signal. It knows nothing about transports.
- `routes.js` is the result callback (`POST /api/browser-control/result`). It
  validates the envelope and hands the outcome to the broker.
- `../../index.js` supplies `emitRequest`, which writes the request to the
  OpenChamber SSE clients and returns how many were reached.
- `../openchamber-control/service.js` is the only caller. It maps `browser.*`
  and `panel.*` actions onto `broker.request()` and owns their parameter
  validation.
- The client half is `packages/ui/src/lib/browser/controlClient.ts`. Only the
  currently visible browser pane registers as the responder. Browser panes stay
  mounted while hidden to preserve page state, but a hidden pane must not claim
  an action: `browser.open` then uses the app-level opener to reveal and focus
  the Browser tab in the right panel before later actions drive it.
- The same client module registers a panel controller from `ContextPanel`.
  `panel.*` actions execute through `packages/ui/src/lib/panel/control.ts` and
  the Zustand store actions used by the UI. They never synthesize desktop input.

## Invariants

- Capability belongs to the connection, not to configuration. A client declares
  it can drive a page by opening its event stream with `browser=1`, which only
  a Chromium host does; the flag lives and dies with that connection, so there
  is no setting to enable and no restart to remember.
- A mounted right-panel owner similarly reconnects with `panel=1`. The server
  sends `panel.*` only to declared owners, and the client claims only requests
  whose normalized directory matches the panel it currently displays.
- `emitRequest` counts only clients that can serve the action. `browser.open`
  needs any client, because opening a tab is what creates a view; every other
  action needs a declared-capable one.
- Exactly one client performs a request. The broadcast reaches everyone who
  could serve it, so a client claims the request over
  `POST /api/browser-control/claim` and acts only if granted; the first claim
  wins and every other client does nothing. Deciding by whose result arrives
  first would be too late, because by then each of them has already clicked.
  A claim for a settled request is refused for the same reason.
- Nobody listening is answered immediately with a 503 describing the
  environment, never by blocking for the full timeout. A blocked wait followed
  by a timeout cannot be told apart from a page that hung.
- A client that accepted a request and then disappeared still times out.
  Assuming success would report a page interaction that never happened.
- A result for an unknown request id is accepted with `matched: false`, not an
  error: a client answering after the timeout has behaved correctly.
- The result route parses its own body. This server has no global body parser,
  and a missing one silently turns every answer into an agent-visible timeout.
- Request payload limits are sized for a page snapshot (visible text plus every
  interactive element), not for a control message.
